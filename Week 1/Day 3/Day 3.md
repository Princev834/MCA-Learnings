# 📅 Day 3 - Python Lists & Strings + HTML Forms

## ✅ What I Did
- Practiced Python list & string problems:
  1. Largest in list
  2. Frequency count
  3. Remove duplicates
  4. Anagram check
  5. Word & character count
- Created first HTML form with text fields, radio, checkboxes, dropdown.
- Organized everything in Day3 folder and pushed to GitHub.

## 📘 What I Learned
- List operations (`append`, `remove`, `set()` for duplicates).
- String manipulation (`split`, `sorted` for anagrams).
- HTML form basics and different input types.

## ❓ Doubts / Challenges
- How to validate form inputs with JavaScript? (for later).
